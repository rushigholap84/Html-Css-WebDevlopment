                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931,
                    to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras
                    Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner
                    and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned
                    a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited
                    Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
                    family.His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous
                    properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu
                    and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
                    trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
                    pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in
                    1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s,
                    apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a
                    young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.
